# State of Notes

My current organization for these notes is a bit weird. I, initially, viewed these notes as a way to share the knowledge I was trying to gain. Now, these notes are more for trying to retain and reference the notes for myself.

## TODO

[] Link Functions, types and list comprehension notes together
[] Render out notes to PDF for local usage
